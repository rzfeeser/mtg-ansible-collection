# Demo using ansible.builtin.uri module to demo interaction with api.magicthegathering.io
#   using only the Ansible standard library. Specifically, this playbook shows keys available from
#   api.magicthegathering.io/v1/cards
- name: Access api.magicthegathering.io/v1/cards
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  connection: local

  tasks:
  # Make a request to api.magicthegathering.io/v1/cards
  - name: Send get request to mtg cards api
    ansible.builtin.uri:
      method: GET                # send this HTTP method
      url: https://api.magicthegathering.io/v1/cards
      status_code: 200           # OPTIONAL - we expect this response code back
      return_content: true
    register: mtg_cards          # create this variable

  - name: Show that the content was still retrieved
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      var: mtg_cards.json.cards  # display the variable we just created
                                 # specifically [json][cards]
    
  - name: Loop through the data returned and display only the keys available
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      msg: "{{ item.keys() }}"
    loop: "{{ mtg_cards.json.cards }}"
    loop_control:
      label: "{{ item.keys() }}"
